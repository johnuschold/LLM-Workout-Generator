With straight arms unrack the bar..2.Lower the bar to your mid chest.3.Raise the bar until you've locked your elbows..Detailed How-To.Do Your Work Early (The Setup).Foot Placement.You can either be flat footed or just have toes on the ground. Either way, push your toes to generate some tension in your quads. Generating tension through your whole body will help you lift more weight..Torso Technique.Point your rib cage at the ceiling and pull your shoulder blades back really hard. Dig your shoulder blades into the bench. This will arch your spine somewhat. This is the only time it is ok to extend your spine. Because you are braced against the bench, the bench will soak up a lot of the tension that would otherwise fall on your lumbar spine..Grip.Grip width should be just outside of shoulder width. Make sure the bar is set very deeply in your hands. This will help prevent your wrists from getting extended, which will in run help you handle more weight safely..Performing The Bench Press.Un-rack the bar. Break at the elbows and bring the bar toward your rib cage, not chest. The bar path should be an arc like curve..Make sure the bar touches your rib cage before you initiate the concentric..At the top of the rep, extend your elbows but stop short of hyperextending as this could lead to an injury..When the rep is complete, slam the bar back into the rack, then lower into the hooks/cups..Ty's Tips.Timing is everything.As you perform the eccentric, you want to move under control, but not slowly. I've seen many times a client or friend miss a heavy rep on the bench press because they moved too slowly during the lowering phase. Moving slowly during the eccentric is usually caused by unsureness. Think about it, when you're lifting a heavy weight, and not sure if you are going to complete it, you move slower..Also, try to properly time out when you initiate the press. You should begin pressing back toward the ceiling as the bar is touching your sternum..Lift with confidence always! If you fail the rep, then you failed the rep. No big deal. Just keep it pushing and you'll get it at some point. This leads me to my second tip..No Shame in Asking For Help.Don't be hesitant to ask for a spot if you don't have a gym partner. Most people are happy to help. There's research showing that a lifter will perform better with a spotter. Your muscles won't be any stronger with or without a spotter of course. So why the improvement in performance? The confidence alluded to in the how-to section. Knowing someone is there to get the bar if you fail provides the security to allow you to lift with confidence..Just make sure you communicate before starting the set..First, ask them to give you a lift off. I've had many ask me for a spot then say they don't want a lift off. Never quite understood why. In many cases (unless you have very long arms), you will lose your shoulder blade retraction when trying to un-rack the bar. If your arms are mostly extended the only choice you have to un-rack is to protract your shoulder blades. The further you can get your shoulder blades pulled back the better. Retracting the shoulder blades also gives more room in the shoulder joint so it is generally a safer position..Also, let the spotter know how many reps you're going for so they know what to expect and don't jump in too early. Let them know whether or not you want help completing any reps. For example, ""I'm going for 10 reps, but I might fail around 8. If I can't get all the reps by myself, can you help me get the remaining ones?"".Although, I suggest once you hit muscular fatigue, you end your set. Once a muscle hits fatigue, doing additional reps does not induce more muscle growth, but does fatigue you more.

Because you are braced against the bench, the bench will soak up a lot of the tension that would otherwise fall on your lumbar spine..Grip.Grip width should be exactly shoulder width.

Instructions and tips: 1.Stand with your mid-foot under the bar and grip the bar with your hands, about a shoulder width apart..2.Bend your knees, then lift the bar by straightening your back. It is important to keep your back straight..3.Stand to your full height and hold..4.Lower the bar to the floor by bending your knees and keeping your back straight..Ty's Tips.My Deadlift, Not Yours.The deadlift involves many muscles, all of your limbs, and every load-bearing joint (ankles, knees, hips and shoulders) in your body. There are a lot of variables at play. So having hard-and-fast rules about deadlift form is nearly impossible..Your body is your body. That seems like an obvious fact, yet it’s one that’s often overlooked when it comes to form..For example, two people who are the same height may have totally different torso and femur lengths..A person who has a short torso and long femurs will have a more hip-dominant pull, meaning that their butt will be higher in the air and most of the force will come from their glutes and hamstrings. Meanwhile, a person who has a long torso and short femurs would be able to get lower and involve their quads a bit more..Detailed How To.#1. Your stance.Conventional Deadlift Foot Placement: You can start with your feet shoulder-width apart. If you’re not sure where this is, try this: Jump in the air 2-3 times. Where your feet land naturally is the proper stance for the conventional deadlift. Your toes should point forward or outward slightly..Set up so that the bar is about an inch to an inch-and-a-half from your shins. When you look down at the bar, it should be positioned right about the middle of your foot, blocking the laces of your shoes from view..#2. Your grip.Figuring out where to place your hands is quite simple. Just take a shoulder-width grip..Choosing how to grip the bar is a little more complicated, and may change throughout your workout. There are three main options:.Option #1: The double-overhand grip. This is the “best” grip most of the time. As you increase the amount of weight you can deadlift, you’ll eventually reach a weight where your grip strength becomes an issue. That’s when mixed grip comes in….Option #2: The mixed grip. Also known as “one overhand, one underhand” grip, this style allows you to pull heavier weights more easily. .Option #3: The hook grip. This grip is not very popular and for good reason—it hurts, but it’s not without benefits. The idea behind the hook grip is that you can use more weight than a double-overhand grip, since your thumbs act as hooks for the bar. But here’s the thing: Much of the weight ends up pulling on your thumbs. The stress this places on the tissue, bones, and joints of your thumbs does not feel good. One way people attempt to eliminate the grip problem altogether is to use straps..Executing the Deadlift.You really only need to think about two things when you pull the bar:.Push off the floor.Keep everything tight (especially your core and lats).During a conventional deadlift, if you are thinking about “pushing the floor away,” it will help you generate tension throughout your hips and knees..Keeping your core, arms, and lats engaged will help you avoid rounding your spine, which is dangerous. DO NOT ROUND YOUR SPINE..When you reach the top of the rep, known as lockout, be careful.Some people seem to think that “locking out” means “leaning back,” but nothing could be further from the truth. Doing that hyperextends your knees and spine, which can compress those all-important spinal discs between your vertebrae. DO NOT HYPEREXTEND YOUR SPINE..The goal, really, is to just stand up..How To Do A Barbell Deadlift, Traps (mid-back) Exercise, Lower back Exercise, How to do Barbell Deadlift, advanced exercise, Mid Back Exercise, advanced Barbell exercise, Lower Back Exercise, Traps (Mid-Back) Exercise, Lower Back"\n"The 'Barbell Deficit Conventional Deadlift' is a 'Intermediate' level 'Muscle Building' exercise that targets the 'glutes' and requires 'barbell'.

Grab some type of pad to go between your hips and the barbell. Getting the bar into place can be challenging depending on what you have access to. .If you've got access to a weighted barbell like in our demo video, either place the bar on your hips while seated on the box or bench and slide down until your shoulder blades are at the edge of the box. Or, slide into position, with the bar standing vertically next to you, then carefully tip the bar over you and onto your hips. .If you have plates that roll on the bar, it becomes a lot easier. In that instance, just roll the bar into place over your hips. .If you have the 12 sided plates (most gyms will have these), it's a lot more challenging. You'll have to get the bar as close to straight over your hips as you can and then scoot into position. .Once you have the bar in place on your hip bones, take your stance. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, and toes facing forward. You don't want your feet too far forward or back. If your feet are too far forward, it will shorten the range of motion. If your feet are too far back you will turn the hip thrust into more of a quadricep movement. .Once you have your stance, grab the bar with either a double overhand or mixed grip. Your hands should only be keeping the bar in place as you perform the movement. Make sure your shoulder blades are pulled back and dug into the box. Now we initiate the hip thrust..Performing The Barbell Hip thrust.Force your hips as high as you can. Hip Thrust variations do something no other glute movements do. The tension is at its highest at the top of the movement when the glutes are in their contracted or shortened position. Therefore, the most important part of the hip thrust is the very top end of the range of motion. You will know you're in the right spot when you feel your glutes contract really hard..There is no need to touch your butt or the plates all the way back to the floor on each rep. Just go as low as you can without touching the plates back down to the floor.

Instructions and tips: 1.Take a roughly shoulder width grip. There should be a straight line from your elbow to fist (vertical forearms)..2.Pull your chin back and press the weight toward the ceiling by extending at the elbow joint and flexing at the shoulder joint..3.Press until your elbows are extended and push your head forward slightly..4.Return to the start position with control. Pulling your chin back to allow the bar to pass your face safely..How To Perform The Barbell Overhead Press.Setup.Place the hooks or cups in the barbell rack just below shoulder height. This way you don't have to go up onto your tippy toes to get the bar out of the rack. Take a shoulder width or slightly outside of shoulder width grip. You can use a thumbed or thumbless grip. Be very careful with a thumbless grip please. Either way, make sure the bar is set very deeply into your hands. If the bar is not deep in your palm, you will likely get extended wrists. Wrist extension will put a lot of pressure onto your wrists and will cause either discomfort or outright pain. And of course this will limit the amount of weight you can use..Once you have your grip, push your elbows underneath the bar. The bar should be roughly at your collar bones. Break at the knees and do a mini squat to get the bar up and out of the rack. Take two steps back. Your stance should be about shoulder or slightly outside shoulder width..Performing.Pull your chin back as you initiate the concentric. Press the bar toward the ceiling. Once the bar has cleared your head, push your head forward slightly. I like to use the cue, ""head through the window."" Don't force your head all the way forward as it's unnecessary and might produce unneeded stress on your neck..You should fully extend your elbows at the top of each rep. If you have hypermobile elbows (many women do) don't hyperextend your elbows at the top. There should be a straight line from your shoulder joint to your fist..Once you have hit elbow extension, time to begin the concentric. Make sure to control the weight on your way down. As the bar is getting to about head height, pull your chin back again to let the bar pass by your face. .Pay particular attention to cheating on this exercise. This is a strict overhead barbell press. It is very easy when you fatigue to begin using your legs to help you get the bar up.  Make sure you keep your lower body from helping at all..Also pay particular attention to your lumbar spine. It is very common for people to lean back and hyper extend their lower back in order to get the bar all the way overhead. Your nervous system is very smart, and knows that you are stronger pushing horizontally than you are vertically. It will therefore, naturally try to turn the overhead press into a horizontal press. This is a very dangerous position for your lower back.

Instructions and tips: 1.Take a shoulder width, double overhand or mixed grip..2.Push your hips back while leaving your knees mostly extended. Look for a stretch in your hamstrings..3.When you feel the stretch, push your hips forward until you're back in a standing position..How To Perform The Romanian Deadlift.Setup.The Romanian Deadlift (RDL), unlike other deadlift variations, begins and ends in the standing position. So you need to begin the exercise a little bit differently than you would other deadlift variations..There are a few ways to set up for the Romanian Deadlift..Set the safety bars or hooks in a squat rack just below knee height. From here, you will squat the bar up and out of the safeties. Take a couple of steps back and then initiate the set..Start from the floor. Perform a standard conventional deadlift to get the weight into the starting position..Once you have chosen one of those two ways, and gotten into the starting standing position we can continue the rest of the set up.  .Use a shoulder width stance with your toes facing forward. Either a double overhand or mixed grip is OK. There is some risk with the mixed grip variation. On very rare occasions a lifter will pull their bicep on the arm with the underhand grip. So be careful..You want to avoid doing any shrugging of the barbell. This is a posterior chain movement not a trap movement. .Performing The Romanian Deadlift.Begin the set by pushing your hips straight back. Your knees should stay mostly extended during the set. You can have a slight bend in the knees, but only slight. As you push your hips back, imagine trying to push your hips upwards towards the ceiling as well. This will help you keep your knees in a more extended position..The Romanian Deadlift is a movement that does something unique. It lengthens the hamstring under a load. During an RDL the tension is at its highest when your hamstring is at its most lengthened position (90° at the hips with extended knees). Therefore, the most important part of this exercise is feeling the stretch in your hamstring on each trip. .You can also use this to dictate your range of motion. Some people will be able to go all the way to the floor while maintaining a flat back. While others will only be able to get to a 90° hip angle. A rare person with hypermobile hips may even need to consider a Deficit RDL. In which they stand on a platform, letting them go even lower than the barbell and plates would allow for. Again, look for the stretch on each rep and use that feeling to dictate when you initiate the concentric portion of the movement. When you feel the stretch, time to come back up..It's of the utmost importance you keep a flat back so you do not put any unnecessary stress on your lumbar spine. This does not mean you will not feel this exercise in your lower back. The opposite is true. You can and most likely will feel the RDL working your lumbar spine. This does not mean you are doing anything wrong. The lower back has muscles just like everywhere else in your body. These muscles can also fill with blood giving you a pump in your lower back. Unlike having a pump in your biceps or pecs, a pump in your lower back is very uncomfortable because the spinal erectors swell and begin to press into your lumbar spine. Again, this does not mean you were doing anything wrong. You can even expect some soreness in your lower back after performing this movement.The concentric portion of this movement is relatively simple. Just go to a standing position to complete the rep. Do not force your hips all the way forward as this will hyperextend your lumbar spine. Hyperextension is just as dangerous as hyperflexion..Hamstrings Exercise, intermediate Barbell exercise, Leg Exercise, Glutes Exercise, Hamstring Exercise, Glute Exercise, Butt Exercise, How To Do A Barbell Romanian Deadlift, How to do Barbell Romanian Deadlift"\n"The 'Barbell Seated Calf Raise' is a 'Beginner' level 'Muscle Building' exercise that targets the 'calves, soleus' and requires 'barbell'.

So you need to begin the exercise a little bit differently than you would the other deadlift variations..There are a few ways to set up for the stiff leg deadlift..Set the safety bars or hooks in a squat rack just below knee height. From here, you will squat the bar up and out of the safeties. Take a couple of steps back and then initiate the set..Start from the floor. Perform a standard conventional deadlift to get the weight into the starting position..Once you have chosen one of those two ways, and gotten into the starting standing position we can continue the rest of the set up.  .Use a shoulder width stance with your toes facing forward. Either a double overhand or mixed grip is OK. There is some risk with the mixed grip variation. On very rare occasions a lifter will pull their bicep on the arm with the underhand grip. So be careful..You want to avoid doing any shrugging of the barbell. This is a posterior chain movement not a trap movement. .Performing.Begin the set by pushing your hips straight back. Your knees should stay mostly extended during the set. You can have a slight bend in the knees, but only slight. As you push your hips back, imagine trying to push your hips upwards towards the ceiling as well. This will help you keep your knees in a more extended position..The Stiff Leg Deadlift is a movement that does something unique. It lengthens the hamstring under a load. During a Stiff Leg Deadlift the tension is at its highest when your hamstring is at its most lengthened position (90° at the hips with extended knees). Therefore, the most important part of this exercise is feeling the stretch in your hamstring on each trip. .You can also use this to dictate your range of motion. Some people will be able to go all the way to the floor while maintaining a flat back. While others will only be able to get to a 90° hip angle. A rare person with hypermobile hips may even need to consider a Deficit Stiff Leg Deadlift. In which they stand on a platform, letting them go even lower than the barbell and plates would allow for. Again, look for the stretch on each rep and use that feeling to dictate when you initiate the concentric portion of the movement. When you feel the stretch, time to come back up..It's of the utmost importance you keep a flat back so you do not put any unnecessary stress on your lumbar spine. This does not mean you will not feel this exercise in your lower back. The opposite is true. You can and most likely will feel the Stiff Leg Deadlift working your lumbar spine. This does not mean you are doing anything wrong. The lower back has muscles just like everywhere else in your body. These muscles can also fill with blood giving you a pump in your lower back. Unlike having a pump on your biceps or pecs, a pump in your lower back is very uncomfortable because the spinal erectors swell and begin to press into your lumbar spine. Again, this does not mean you were doing anything wrong. You can even expect some soreness in your lower back after performing this movement.The concentric portion of this movement is relatively simple. Just go to a standing position to complete the rep. Do not force your hips all the way forward as this will hyperextend your lumbar spine. Hyperextension is just as dangerous as hyperflexion..How To Do A Barbell Stiff Leg Deadlifts, Butt Exercise, intermediate Barbell exercise, Glutes Exercise, Leg Exercise, Glute Exercise, Hamstrings Exercise, How to do Barbell Stiff Leg Deadlifts, Hamstring Exercise"\n"The 'Barbell Suitcase Carry' is a 'Advanced' level 'Muscle Building' exercise that targets the 'hamstrings, glutes, obliques, hands' and requires 'barbell'.

Raise the dumbbells until you have straight arms..2.Lower the dumbbells to your mid chest.3.Raise the dumbbells until you've locked your elbows..How To Perform The Dumbbell Incline Bench Press.Setup.Set an incline bench at around 30° high. Any higher than 30°, and the tension will go to your anterior deltoid as opposed to your upper pecs. A low incline is all you need. .Getting the dumbbells into position for an incline bench press can be challenging. You've got a couple of options here..Start with the dumbbells sitting vertically on your quads. Push one leg up toward the ceiling and get your elbow underneath the dumbbell. Then repeat on the other leg with the other dumbbell as you fall back onto the bench. .Have a gym partner help out. If you're going to have someone help. Make sure they either grab your wrists or the dumbbells themselves to help you get into position. Some people have a tendency to push the elbows up in order to get the dumbbells in position for this move. This can be dangerous as the dumbbell might fall laterally one direction, or another..Make sure both feet are planted firmly on the ground. Push your toes through the front of your shoes. This will generate some tension through your quads and keep you more stable. .Like any other bench press, pull your shoulder blades back and dig them into the bench. Also point your ribs up toward the ceiling, giving yourself a minor arch in your spine. .Performing .Press the weights up toward the ceiling to initiate your first rep. Extend your elbows, but do not fully lock them out. As you perform the eccentric, maintain a 45° angle between your upper arm and torso. Your elbows should not be flared all the way out, or tucked all the way in, but in the middle between the two. .Stop the eccentric when your elbows are even with your torso or slightly behind your torso. The pecs are not designed well to function when your upper arm travels behind your body. Because the pecs are two lengthened in this position, they will not be able to generate force properly. All the tension from the dumbbells will go onto your shoulder joint instead of your muscles. .Getting from underneath the dumbbells at the end of the set can be challenging as well. You also have two options here. .If you end the set by completing your last rep, meaning your elbows are extended and the dumbbells are away from your body, turn your fists into a neutral position, lift your legs up touching the dumbbell to your quads, and then roll your entire body forward. This can take some practice, so try it with light dumbbells first..If you end the set not having completed your final rep, meaning the dumbbells are against your chest, then you have no choice but to dump the dumbbells off of you onto the ground. Be very careful with this. Do your best to control the weights as you get them off of you, so they do not bounce. If the dumbbells bounce off the floor and land on someone's foot, you have an issue on your hands. Some gyms don't want any dropping of weights at all. Try to set them down as gently as possible, but don't injure yourself in the process..Incline, Pecs, How To Do A Dumbbell Incline Bench Press, Dumbbell Exercise, Pec Exercise, Chest Exercise, How to do Dumbbell Incline Bench Press, Chest, beginner Dumbbells exercise, Bench Press"\n"The 'Dumbbell Incline Chest Fly' is a 'Beginner' level 'Muscle Building' exercise that targets the 'chest, upper-pectoralis' and requires 'dumbbells'.

When you begin from the hips on the ground position, your lumbar spine is hyperextended, which is dangerous and to be avoided in the overwhelming majority of exercises..You can either do a closed fist or open hand position. Whichever feels more comfortable. Step one foot back, and then the other to begin the Plank..Performing The Forearm Plank.Be careful to not let your hips rise or sag as you were holding the forearm Plank. Maintain a flat back the entire set. If you are having trouble knowing if your back is flat, try performing the exercise in front of a mirror so you can check your form. .Continuously press your elbows into the ground and spread your scapula. This will recruit your serratus anterior and get you some extra core work..How To Progress The Forearm Plank:.Like any other exercise, progression is important with the Plank. However, since the Plank is a hold and not a dynamic exercise with reps, it can be challenging knowing how to and when to progress the Plank. Here’s a quick step by step guide on progressing the Plank.Set a range similar to a rep range. For example, 45 to 60 seconds. Let’s say in the beginning you are only able to do 45 seconds. Each week, try to add a bit more time (2-5 secs). Once you are able to complete 60 seconds with good form time to further progress..Switch to a more difficult variation. The natural next step is switching to the Hand Plank. Keep your same time range of 45-60 seconds. Since this is a more difficult variation you will likely fatigue before 60 seconds. Build your way back to 60 seconds like you did with the Forearm Plank. .Add weight. At this point, it’s time to try adding some resistance to the Plank. Start light! You can either ask a gym buddy or place the weight on your back yourself. Either way, make sure the plate is in the middle of your upper back and not your lumbar spine. Then you can progress the plank similarly to any other exercise. By adding weight bit by bit overtime..You can continue to progress by going to a more difficult hold (Long Lever Plank, Hollow Hold) and then adding weight to those over time..Abdominal Exercise, Abs, How to do Forearm Plank, Bodyweight Exercise, Abs Exercise, How To Do A Forearm Plank, At Home Exercise, beginner Bodyweight exercise, Abdominals Exercise, Bodyweight Fitness"\n"The 'Forearms Stretch Variation Four' is a 'Beginner' level 'Stretching' exercise that targets the 'forearms' and requires 'None'.

Also, this cue will help you keep your torso vertical..Performing.Initiate the first rep by taking a step forward. You should dictate your stride length by the body part you'd like to focus on.

Instructions and tips: 1.Start in a kneeling position with your hands planted on the ground..2.Pick your knees up off the ground. Hold in this position with a flat back..Hand Plank Detailed How to:.Setup.I suggest starting in a kneeling position as opposed to starting with your hips on the ground. When you begin from the hips on the ground position, your lumbar spine is hyperextended, which is dangerous and to be avoided in the overwhelming majority of exercises..You can either do a closed fist or open hand position. Whichever feels more comfortable. Step one foot back, and then the other to begin the Plank..Performing The Hand Plank.Be careful to not let your hips rise or sag as you were holding the Hand Plank. Maintain a flat back the entire set. If you are having trouble knowing if your back is flat, try performing the exercise in front of a mirror so you can check your form. .Continuously press your hands into the ground and spread your scapula. This will recruit your serratus anterior and get you some extra core work..How To Progress The Hand Plank:.Like any other exercise, progression is important with the Plank. However, since the Plank is a hold and not a dynamic exercise with reps, it can be challenging knowing how to and when to progress the Plank. Here’s a quick step by step guide on progressing the Plank.Set a range similar to a rep range. For example, 45 to 60 seconds. Let’s say in the beginning you are only able to do 45 seconds. Each week, try to add a bit more time (2-5 secs). Once you are able to complete 60 seconds with good form time to further progress..Switch to a more difficult variation. The natural next step is switching to the Hand Plank. Keep your same time range of 45-60 seconds. Since this is a more difficult variation you will likely fatigue before 60 seconds. Build your way back to 60 seconds like you did with the Forearm Plank. .Add weight. At this point, it’s time to try adding some resistance to the Plank. Start light! You can either ask a gym buddy or place the weight on your back yourself. Either way, make sure the plate is in the middle of your upper back and not your lumbar spine. Then you can progress the plank similarly to any other exercise. By adding weight bit by bit overtime..You can continue to progress by going to a more difficult hold (Long Lever Plank, Hollow Hold) and then adding weight to those over time..Hold, How To Do A Hand Plank, How to do Hand Plank, Bodyweight Fitness, beginner Bodyweight exercise, Abdominals, At Home Exercise, Best, Abs, Abdominals Exercise, Bodyweight Exercise, Abdominal Exercise, Abs Exercise"\n"The 'Hand Side Plank' is a 'Beginner' level 'Muscle Building' exercise that targets the 'obliques' and requires 'bodyweight'.

Instructions and tips: 1.Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, arms and shoulders fully extended..2.Pull your body up until your chin is above the bar..3.Lower your body back to starting position..How To Perform The Pull Up.Setup.Grab the Pull Up bar with an overhand grip. If you get wrist pain from gripping a Pull Up bar, try using a thumbless grip. It won't affect your grip strength too much, but will give your wrists a little more room to move. Also, make sure the bars are set very deeply in your hand. Your palms should be making contact with the bar. .Next, if you are using a bench or box to reach the Pull Up bars, step off of the step, and hold for a second, in a dead hang position. If you begin initiating the Pull Up before the dead hang, you might swing too much to perform a proper strict Pull Up. If you can reach the Pull Up bars without having to stand on anything, take your grip and then pull your feet slightly off the floor. Still hold for a second to prevent any swinging from happening..Pull your shoulder blades down. This will engage your mid and lower traps and force your lats to do most of the work. Also, before beginning the first rep, make sure your elbows are extended..Lower body.Angle your legs forward slightly, push your hips back, and point your toes. This will force you to flex your abdominals and keep you more stable throughout the rep. (This will massively help you keep the reps strict)..Performing.Once you are in the proper position, begin to pull. Imagine trying to pull your elbows not just down, but inward toward your spine. This cue will help you engage one of the lats’ more overlooked functions, vertical adduction. .Get your chin over the bar before beginning the eccentric portion of the rap. Your elbows should fully extend at the bottom of each rep..Step by Step Progression.The Pull Up can be a difficult exercise to know when to progress. There's also the question of how to progress the Pull Up. .Decide on a rep range. For example, 6 to 10. Once you are able to perform 10 reps with strict form, then it is time to progress. Do not be shy or hesitant to start adding weight to your Pull Up early on. Even if it is only 5 pounds. Progress is progress! From there, progress the Pull Up, like it would any other exercise. Once you hit the top end of the rep range, add some more weight..The best way to get better at doing Pull Ups is to do Pull Ups. But if you can't do them in the first place, then what should you do? .Try the Chin Up. It’s an easier variation because the biceps are much more involved. I suggest you start with that variation if you don't have much experience doing Pull Ups. .Shorten the range of motion, and try to get a longer range of motion overtime. if you can only do half a Pull Up (meaning you can get your elbows to roughly 90°) don't be ashamed to do those half reps. Set a rep range like with anything else. We will use 5 to 8 reps for this example. Once you are able to hit 8/2 Pull Ups, cut the reps down to five and try to go an extra 2 to 3 inches higher on each rep. It helps massively if you can do this in front of a mirror to keep a very close eye on your range of motion.
