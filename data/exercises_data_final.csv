Lay flat on the bench with your feet on the ground. With straight arms unrack the bar.
2
Lower the bar to your mid chest
3
Raise the bar until you've locked your elbows.

Detailed How-To
Do Your Work Early (The Setup)
Foot Placement
You can either be flat footed or just have toes on the ground. Either way, push your toes to generate some tension in your quads. Generating tension through your whole body will help you lift more weight.
Torso Technique
Point your rib cage at the ceiling and pull your shoulder blades back really hard. Dig your shoulder blades into the bench. This will arch your spine somewhat. This is the only time it is ok to extend your spine. Because you are braced against the bench, the bench will soak up a lot of the tension that would otherwise fall on your lumbar spine.
Grip
Grip width should be just outside of shoulder width. Make sure the bar is set very deeply in your hands. This will help prevent your wrists from getting extended, which will in run help you handle more weight safely.
Performing The Bench Press
Un-rack the bar. Break at the elbows and bring the bar toward your rib cage, not chest. The bar path should be an arc like curve.
Make sure the bar touches your rib cage before you initiate the concentric.
At the top of the rep, extend your elbows but stop short of hyperextending as this could lead to an injury.
When the rep is complete, slam the bar back into the rack, then lower into the hooks/cups.
Ty's Tips
Timing is everything
As you perform the eccentric, you want to move under control, but not slowly. I've seen many times a client or friend miss a heavy rep on the bench press because they moved too slowly during the lowering phase. Moving slowly during the eccentric is usually caused by unsureness. Think about it, when you're lifting a heavy weight, and not sure if you are going to complete it, you move slower.
Also, try to properly time out when you initiate the press. You should begin pressing back toward the ceiling as the bar is touching your sternum.
Lift with confidence always! If you fail the rep, then you failed the rep. No big deal. Just keep it pushing and you'll get it at some point. This leads me to my second tip.
No Shame in Asking For Help
Don't be hesitant to ask for a spot if you don't have a gym partner. Most people are happy to help. There's research showing that a lifter will perform better with a spotter. Your muscles won't be any stronger with or without a spotter of course. So why the improvement in performance? The confidence alluded to in the how-to section. Knowing someone is there to get the bar if you fail provides the security to allow you to lift with confidence.
Just make sure you communicate before starting the set.
First, ask them to give you a lift off. I've had many ask me for a spot then say they don't want a lift off. Never quite understood why. In many cases (unless you have very long arms), you will lose your shoulder blade retraction when trying to un-rack the bar. If your arms are mostly extended the only choice you have to un-rack is to protract your shoulder blades. The further you can get your shoulder blades pulled back the better. Retracting the shoulder blades also gives more room in the shoulder joint so it is generally a safer position.
Also, let the spotter know how many reps you're going for so they know what to expect and don't jump in too early. Let them know whether or not you want help completing any reps. For example, ""I'm going for 10 reps, but I might fail around 8. If I can't get all the reps by myself, can you help me get the remaining ones?""
Although, I suggest once you hit muscular fatigue, you end your set. Once a muscle hits fatigue, doing additional reps does not induce more muscle growth, but does fatigue you more. Too much risk, not enough reward.

88,Barbell Bent Over Row,"biceps, lats, forearms",barbell,Intermediate,Muscle Building,"1
Grab a barbell with a shoulder width pronated or supinated grip.
2
Bend forward at your hips while maintaining a flat back.
3
Pull the weight toward your upper abdomen.
4
Lower the weight in a controlled manner and repeat.

How To Perform The Barbell Row (Supinated) 

Setting Up
Grab your barbell with an underhand/supinated grip. Stay with feet about shoulder width apart or a little more narrow. Push your butt back and hinge at the hips. Make sure you keep your back flat throughout the entirety of this exercise. Before beginning your set, let your elbows fully extend.

The closer your torso is to parallel with the ground. The longer the range of motion will be during your row. The more vertical your torso is, the shorter the range of motion. It's extremely important to hinge as far forward as you can without rounding your back and maintaining that torso position for the entire set.

Performing 
Pull your elbows straight back toward the ceiling until the bar touches your torso. The bar should land somewhere between your belly button and your rib cage. Use the cue, ""squeeze the tennis ball."" Imagine you have a tennis ball in your armpits and when you perform each rep try to squeeze that tennis ball.

On the eccentric, let your elbows fully extend before initiating the next rep. Ego lifting is very easy to do with the barbell row. If you find yourself having to bounce or use momentum to get the weight from point A to point B, the weight is too heavy. Your torso should maintain its horizontal position for the entire set.

Barbell Bulgarian Split Squat: A Comprehensive Guide
Setup
Start by positioning a barbell on a squat rack or in a landmine setup.
Step under the bar and grasp it with a palms-forward grip, just outside of your hips.
Lift the bar from the rack and stand with your feet hip-width apart and the barbell resting across your upper back.
Take a large step forward with your right foot and place your left foot behind you, keeping it on a bench or elevated surface.
How to Perform
Bend your right knee, lowering your torso towards the ground until your left knee almost touches it.
Pause, then push through your right heel to return to the starting position.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs and repeat with your left foot forward.
Technique
Keep your chest lifted and your core engaged throughout the exercise.
Make sure your front knee stays directly above your ankle and doesn't move forward past your toes.
Keep your weight evenly distributed between both feet, and avoid shifting too much weight onto your back foot.
Inhale as you lower down and exhale as you push back up to the starting position.
Things to Avoid
Avoid rounding your lower back or hunching forward as you lower down.
Don't allow your front knee to collapse inward.
Avoid shifting your weight too far forward onto your front foot, as this can put unnecessary strain on your knee.
Don't let your back foot come off the bench or elevated surface during the exercise.

How To Do The Barbell Calve Raise

Setup

Place the barbell hooks just below shoulder height so you don't have to go up on your tippy toes to un-rack and re-rack the bar.

Take a wider than shoulder width grip. Whatever is most comfortable. Shrug your shoulders up and press your upper traps into the bar. Break at the knees and hips and squat out of the barbell hooks. Take two steps back into a shoulder width stance with your toes facing forward.

In our demo video, I am performing the exercise flat on the ground. You can get a longer range of motion by putting a plate or a small step in front of you to place the balls of your feet on. This will let you flex your ankles to a much greater extent.

Performing

Start flat footed. Pull your heels up as high as your ankle range of motion will allow for. You should feel a hard contraction in your calf muscle. Spend an extra second in this contracted position before going back to the starting point.
Be careful with this exercise. It can be alluring to use too much weight. If you are having trouble maintaining a neutral spine, or are unable to keep your knees mostly extended, then the weight is too heavy. Your central nervous system is very smart. If you approach this exercise with the mindset of simply getting from point A to point B, your nervous system will begin to recruit your quadriceps into the movement by slightly flexing and extending your knee joints.

How To Perform The Close Grip Bench Press

Setting Up

Foot Placement
You can either be flat footed or just have toes on the ground. Either way, push your toes to generate some tension in your quads. Generating tension through your whole body will help you lift more weight. 

Torso Technique
Point your rib cage at the ceiling and pull your shoulder blades back really hard. Dig your shoulder blades into the bench. This will arch your spine somewhat. This is the only time it is ok to extend your spine. Because you are braced against the bench, the bench will soak up a lot of the tension that would otherwise fall on your lumbar spine.

Grip
Grip width should be exactly shoulder width.  Bringing your hands closer than shoulder width will not increase the range of motion at your elbows (the joint the triceps act on). And going any closer than shoulder width tends to only put more stress on your wrist and shoulder joints. If you are not sure what a shoulder width grip is, simply point both of your arms straight out in front of you. You can also lay on the bench and do this. Use the markings on the bar to make sure your hands are even as well. 

Make sure the bar is set very deeply in your hands. This will help keep your wrists in a strong neutral position. Also, this will prevent your wrists from getting extended. 

Performing The close Grip Bench Press
After you have un-racked the bar, you will initiate the rep by breaking at the elbows. Took your elbows very hard into your side. The bar should land lower on your torso than it does with a normal bench press. As you tap your torso with the bar begin to press the bar back up toward the ceiling in a J shaped arc. Make sure to extend (but not hyperextend) your elbows at the top of each rep.

Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level.
3

4
Slowly bring the weight back down to the starting position.

**Detailed How To:**

- Grab the barbell with a shoulder width, underhand grip.
- Flex at the elbows until your forearms press into your bicep (this will look different from person to person).
- Begin to extend your elbows and control the weight during the eccentric part of the exercise.
- Make sure to fully extend your elbows at the end of the rep.
- Repeat until you hit muscular fatigue (1-3 reps left in the tank)

**Ty's Tips**

One of the drawbacks with a Barbell Curl is the bar limits Range of Motion somewhat. The bar will hit your legs before you can fully extend your arms. On most exercises, we want the longest Range or Motion possible. To remedy this,

Push your butt back a tad bit. This will give you a little more room to fully extend your elbows.
Watch out for cheating. Using momentum often naturally happens with a Barbell Curl (and most Dumbbell curl variations). There is a move called the Cheat Curl popularized by Arnold himself. But consider that a separate exercise.

Root your feet to the floor and use a mirror to watch your form. If your hips begin moving and you're unable to continue to perform reps without any hip movement, end the set.
A 6-12 rep range works well for this exercise.

Ty's Tips
My Deadlift, Not Yours
The deadlift involves many muscles, all of your limbs, and every load-bearing joint (ankles, knees, hips and shoulders) in your body. There are a lot of variables at play. So having hard-and-fast rules about deadlift form is nearly impossible.
Your body is your body. That seems like an obvious fact, yet it’s one that’s often overlooked when it comes to form.
For example, two people who are the same height may have totally different torso and femur lengths.
A person who has a short torso and long femurs will have a more hip-dominant pull, meaning that their butt will be higher in the air and most of the force will come from their glutes and hamstrings. Meanwhile, a person who has a long torso and short femurs would be able to get lower and involve their quads a bit more.
Detailed How To
#1. Your stance
Conventional Deadlift Foot Placement: You can start with your feet shoulder-width apart. If you’re not sure where this is, try this: Jump in the air 2-3 times. Where your feet land naturally is the proper stance for the conventional deadlift. Your toes should point forward or outward slightly.
Set up so that the bar is about an inch to an inch-and-a-half from your shins. When you look down at the bar, it should be positioned right about the middle of your foot, blocking the laces of your shoes from view.
#2. Your grip
Figuring out where to place your hands is quite simple. Just take a shoulder-width grip.
Choosing how to grip the bar is a little more complicated, and may change throughout your workout. There are three main options:
Option #1: The double-overhand grip. This is the “best” grip most of the time. As you increase the amount of weight you can deadlift, you’ll eventually reach a weight where your grip strength becomes an issue. That’s when mixed grip comes in…
Option #2: The mixed grip. Also known as “one overhand, one underhand” grip, this style allows you to pull heavier weights more easily. 
Option #3: The hook grip. This grip is not very popular and for good reason—it hurts, but it’s not without benefits. The idea behind the hook grip is that you can use more weight than a double-overhand grip, since your thumbs act as hooks for the bar. But here’s the thing: Much of the weight ends up pulling on your thumbs. The stress this places on the tissue, bones, and joints of your thumbs does not feel good. One way people attempt to eliminate the grip problem altogether is to use straps.
Executing the Deadlift
You really only need to think about two things when you pull the bar:
Push off the floor
Keep everything tight (especially your core and lats)
During a conventional deadlift, if you are thinking about “pushing the floor away,” it will help you generate tension throughout your hips and knees.
Keeping your core, arms, and lats engaged will help you avoid rounding your spine, which is dangerous. DO NOT ROUND YOUR SPINE.
When you reach the top of the rep, known as lockout, be careful
Some people seem to think that “locking out” means “leaning back,” but nothing could be further from the truth. Doing that hyperextends your knees and spine, which can compress those all-important spinal discs between your vertebrae. DO NOT HYPEREXTEND YOUR SPINE.
The goal, really, is to just stand up.

Un-rack the bar and break at the elbows and shoulders.
2
Bring your elbows to the floor, rest for a second to remove all the momentum from the rep, then press to a lockout.

Barbell Floor Press: A Comprehensive Guide
Setup
Start by selecting a barbell that is appropriate for your strength level and place it on the floor.
Lie down on the floor with your back flat and feet flat on the ground. Grasp the barbell with both hands, using a grip that is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
Raise the barbell off the floor so that it is directly above your chest, keeping your arms straight.
Make sure your back is flat on the floor and that your neck and head are in a neutral position.
How to Perform
Slowly lower the barbell to your chest, keeping your elbows close to your sides.
Once the barbell touches your chest, pause for a moment and then press it back up to the starting position.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
Technique
Keep your back flat on the floor and your elbows close to your sides throughout the entire movement.
Focus on using your chest muscles to press the barbell, not your shoulders or triceps.
Maintain a slow and controlled tempo, avoiding any jerking or bouncing movements.
Make sure to inhale as you lower the barbell and exhale as you press it back up.
Things to Avoid
Avoid arching your back or lifting your butt off the floor during the exercise, as this can cause injury to your lower back.
Do not allow your elbows to flare out to the sides, as this places unnecessary stress on your shoulders.
Avoid using too much weight, as this can cause you to lose proper form and increase the risk of injury.

Barbell Hip thrust Detailed How To:

Setup

Grab a box, (or a bench) that is roughly 18 to 24 inches in height. Grab some type of pad to go between your hips and the barbell. Getting the bar into place can be challenging depending on what you have access to. 
If you've got access to a weighted barbell like in our demo video, either place the bar on your hips while seated on the box or bench and slide down until your shoulder blades are at the edge of the box. Or, slide into position, with the bar standing vertically next to you, then carefully tip the bar over you and onto your hips. 
If you have plates that roll on the bar, it becomes a lot easier. In that instance, just roll the bar into place over your hips. 
If you have the 12 sided plates (most gyms will have these), it's a lot more challenging. You'll have to get the bar as close to straight over your hips as you can and then scoot into position. 
Once you have the bar in place on your hip bones, take your stance. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, and toes facing forward. You don't want your feet too far forward or back. If your feet are too far forward, it will shorten the range of motion. If your feet are too far back you will turn the hip thrust into more of a quadricep movement. 

Once you have your stance, grab the bar with either a double overhand or mixed grip. Your hands should only be keeping the bar in place as you perform the movement. Make sure your shoulder blades are pulled back and dug into the box. Now we initiate the hip thrust.

Performing The Barbell Hip thrust

Force your hips as high as you can. Hip Thrust variations do something no other glute movements do. The tension is at its highest at the top of the movement when the glutes are in their contracted or shortened position. Therefore, the most important part of the hip thrust is the very top end of the range of motion. You will know you're in the right spot when you feel your glutes contract really hard.

There is no need to touch your butt or the plates all the way back to the floor on each rep. Just go as low as you can without touching the plates back down to the floor. This will keep tension on your glutes.

Barbell Low Bar Good Morning: A Comprehensive Guide
Setup
Begin by placing a barbell across your upper back and shoulders, using a grip that is just outside of your shoulder blades.
Use a low bar placement, which will be a few inches below the high bar placement used for squats.
Ensure that the barbell is positioned securely, so that it does not move or shift during the exercise.
Set your feet hip-width apart, with your toes pointing forward or slightly outwards.
Activate your core muscles and brace your spine in a neutral position.
How to Perform
Start by taking a deep breath and engaging your core and lower back muscles.
Slowly bend forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your knees slightly bent.
Lower your torso as far as you can while maintaining proper form, then pause and hold for a moment.
Push through your hips to return to the starting position, exhaling as you stand up straight.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, making sure to maintain good form throughout the exercise.
Technique
It is important to keep your back straight and avoid rounding your spine during the movement.
Focus on using your hips and glutes to initiate the movement, rather than your lower back.
Keep your knees slightly bent throughout the exercise to maintain balance and stability.
Do not allow your shoulders to round forward, but instead keep them back and engaged.
Maintain a slow and controlled pace, avoiding any jerky or abrupt movements.
Things to Avoid
Avoid using too heavy of a weight, as this can increase the risk of injury and decrease proper form.
Do not allow your lower back to round or arch excessively, as this can place unnecessary strain on the muscles and spine.
Avoid hinging forward at the waist, as this can cause strain on the lower back and reduce the effectiveness of the exercise.
Do not use momentum or swing the weight, as this can compromise form and increase the risk of injury.
Avoid over-extending at the top of the movement, as this can lead to strain on the lower back and decrease proper form.

How To Perform The Barbell Overhead Press

Setup

Place the hooks or cups in the barbell rack just below shoulder height. This way you don't have to go up onto your tippy toes to get the bar out of the rack. Take a shoulder width or slightly outside of shoulder width grip. You can use a thumbed or thumbless grip. Be very careful with a thumbless grip please. Either way, make sure the bar is set very deeply into your hands. If the bar is not deep in your palm, you will likely get extended wrists. Wrist extension will put a lot of pressure onto your wrists and will cause either discomfort or outright pain. And of course this will limit the amount of weight you can use.

Once you have your grip, push your elbows underneath the bar. The bar should be roughly at your collar bones. Break at the knees and do a mini squat to get the bar up and out of the rack. Take two steps back. Your stance should be about shoulder or slightly outside shoulder width.

Performing

Pull your chin back as you initiate the concentric. Press the bar toward the ceiling. Once the bar has cleared your head, push your head forward slightly. I like to use the cue, ""head through the window."" Don't force your head all the way forward as it's unnecessary and might produce unneeded stress on your neck.

You should fully extend your elbows at the top of each rep. If you have hypermobile elbows (many women do) don't hyperextend your elbows at the top. There should be a straight line from your shoulder joint to your fist.

Once you have hit elbow extension, time to begin the concentric. Make sure to control the weight on your way down. As the bar is getting to about head height, pull your chin back again to let the bar pass by your face. 

Pay particular attention to cheating on this exercise. This is a strict overhead barbell press. It is very easy when you fatigue to begin using your legs to help you get the bar up.  Make sure you keep your lower body from helping at all.

Also pay particular attention to your lumbar spine. It is very common for people to lean back and hyper extend their lower back in order to get the bar all the way overhead. Your nervous system is very smart, and knows that you are stronger pushing horizontally than you are vertically. It will therefore, naturally try to turn the overhead press into a horizontal press. This is a very dangerous position for your lower back. Don't let it happen!

How To Perform The Romanian Deadlift

Setup

The Romanian Deadlift (RDL), unlike other deadlift variations, begins and ends in the standing position. So you need to begin the exercise a little bit differently than you would other deadlift variations.

There are a few ways to set up for the Romanian Deadlift.
Set the safety bars or hooks in a squat rack just below knee height. From here, you will squat the bar up and out of the safeties. Take a couple of steps back and then initiate the set.
Start from the floor. Perform a standard conventional deadlift to get the weight into the starting position.
Once you have chosen one of those two ways, and gotten into the starting standing position we can continue the rest of the set up.  

Use a shoulder width stance with your toes facing forward. Either a double overhand or mixed grip is OK. There is some risk with the mixed grip variation. On very rare occasions a lifter will pull their bicep on the arm with the underhand grip. So be careful.

You want to avoid doing any shrugging of the barbell. This is a posterior chain movement not a trap movement. 

Performing The Romanian Deadlift

Begin the set by pushing your hips straight back. Your knees should stay mostly extended during the set. You can have a slight bend in the knees, but only slight. As you push your hips back, imagine trying to push your hips upwards towards the ceiling as well. This will help you keep your knees in a more extended position.

The Romanian Deadlift is a movement that does something unique. It lengthens the hamstring under a load. During an RDL the tension is at its highest when your hamstring is at its most lengthened position (90° at the hips with extended knees). Therefore, the most important part of this exercise is feeling the stretch in your hamstring on each trip. 

You can also use this to dictate your range of motion. Some people will be able to go all the way to the floor while maintaining a flat back. While others will only be able to get to a 90° hip angle. A rare person with hypermobile hips may even need to consider a Deficit RDL. In which they stand on a platform, letting them go even lower than the barbell and plates would allow for. Again, look for the stretch on each rep and use that feeling to dictate when you initiate the concentric portion of the movement. When you feel the stretch, time to come back up.

It's of the utmost importance you keep a flat back so you do not put any unnecessary stress on your lumbar spine. This does not mean you will not feel this exercise in your lower back. The opposite is true. You can and most likely will feel the RDL working your lumbar spine. This does not mean you are doing anything wrong. The lower back has muscles just like everywhere else in your body. These muscles can also fill with blood giving you a pump in your lower back. Unlike having a pump in your biceps or pecs, a pump in your lower back is very uncomfortable because the spinal erectors swell and begin to press into your lumbar spine. Again, this does not mean you were doing anything wrong. You can even expect some soreness in your lower back after performing this movement

The concentric portion of this movement is relatively simple. Just go to a standing position to complete the rep. Do not force your hips all the way forward as this will hyperextend your lumbar spine. Hyperextension is just as dangerous as hyperflexion.

Barbell Squat: A Comprehensive Guide
The barbell squat is a fundamental strength training exercise that targets multiple muscle groups, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and lower back. This full-body workout provides numerous benefits, such as increased power, endurance, and stability.
In this guide, you will learn how to set up, perform, and maintain proper technique while doing barbell squats, as well as things to avoid.
How To Setup:
Choose the Right Weight: Begin with a light weight and gradually increase the weight as you become more comfortable with the movement.
Gather Equipment: You will need a barbell, weight plates, and a squat rack for this exercise.
Adjust the Squat Rack: Ensure the barbell is positioned at a height that allows you to stand with the barbell resting comfortably on your upper traps.
Load the Barbell: Add weight plates to the barbell using collars to secure the weights in place.
Position Your Feet: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, facing forward.
Grip the Barbell: Grasp the barbell with both hands, using a grip that is slightly wider than shoulder-width.
How To Perform:
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell resting on your upper traps.
Slowly bend your knees and lower your body, keeping your back straight and your head facing forward.
Continue lowering your body until your thighs are parallel to the floor, or lower if you are comfortable doing so.
Pause briefly at the bottom of the squat before pushing back up to the starting position.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
Proper Technique:
Keep Your Back Straight: Maintaining a straight back throughout the exercise helps to prevent injury and engages your lower back muscles.
Drive Through Your Heels: Focus on pushing through your heels as you rise from the bottom of the squat, keeping your weight over your feet.
Don’t Let Your Knees Cave Inward: Keep your knees tracking over your toes and avoid letting them cave inward.
Breathe Properly: Exhale as you push up from the bottom of the squat and inhale as you lower yourself.
Avoid Rounding Your Shoulders: Keep your shoulders back and avoid rounding them forward as this can place strain on your neck and upper back.
Things to Avoid:
Using Too Much Weight: Starting with a weight that is too heavy can compromise your form and increase the risk of injury.
Allowing Your Knees to Collapse Inward: This can place strain on your knee joints and compromise your stability.
Arching Your Lower Back: This can cause lower back pain and injury.
Rounding Your Shoulders: Keep your shoulders back and avoid rounding them forward as this can place strain on your neck and upper back.
Bouncing Out of the Bottom Position: Avoid bouncing out of the bottom position, as this can reduce the effectiveness of the exercise and increase the risk of injury.
Not Maintaining Proper Foot Position: Ensure your feet remain flat on the ground throughout the exercise, as elevating your heels or toes can impact your balance and stability.

How To Perform The Stiff Leg Deadlift

Setup


The Stiff Leg Deadlift, unlike other deadlift variations, begins and ends in the standing position. So you need to begin the exercise a little bit differently than you would the other deadlift variations.

There are a few ways to set up for the stiff leg deadlift.
Set the safety bars or hooks in a squat rack just below knee height. From here, you will squat the bar up and out of the safeties. Take a couple of steps back and then initiate the set.
Start from the floor. Perform a standard conventional deadlift to get the weight into the starting position.
Once you have chosen one of those two ways, and gotten into the starting standing position we can continue the rest of the set up.  

Use a shoulder width stance with your toes facing forward. Either a double overhand or mixed grip is OK. There is some risk with the mixed grip variation. On very rare occasions a lifter will pull their bicep on the arm with the underhand grip. So be careful.

You want to avoid doing any shrugging of the barbell. This is a posterior chain movement not a trap movement. 

Performing

Begin the set by pushing your hips straight back. Your knees should stay mostly extended during the set. You can have a slight bend in the knees, but only slight. As you push your hips back, imagine trying to push your hips upwards towards the ceiling as well. This will help you keep your knees in a more extended position.

The Stiff Leg Deadlift is a movement that does something unique. It lengthens the hamstring under a load. During a Stiff Leg Deadlift the tension is at its highest when your hamstring is at its most lengthened position (90° at the hips with extended knees). Therefore, the most important part of this exercise is feeling the stretch in your hamstring on each trip. 

You can also use this to dictate your range of motion. Some people will be able to go all the way to the floor while maintaining a flat back. While others will only be able to get to a 90° hip angle. A rare person with hypermobile hips may even need to consider a Deficit Stiff Leg Deadlift. In which they stand on a platform, letting them go even lower than the barbell and plates would allow for. Again, look for the stretch on each rep and use that feeling to dictate when you initiate the concentric portion of the movement. When you feel the stretch, time to come back up.

It's of the utmost importance you keep a flat back so you do not put any unnecessary stress on your lumbar spine. This does not mean you will not feel this exercise in your lower back. The opposite is true. You can and most likely will feel the Stiff Leg Deadlift working your lumbar spine. This does not mean you are doing anything wrong. The lower back has muscles just like everywhere else in your body. These muscles can also fill with blood giving you a pump in your lower back. Unlike having a pump on your biceps or pecs, a pump in your lower back is very uncomfortable because the spinal erectors swell and begin to press into your lumbar spine. Again, this does not mean you were doing anything wrong. You can even expect some soreness in your lower back after performing this movement

The concentric portion of this movement is relatively simple. Just go to a standing position to complete the rep. Do not force your hips all the way forward as this will hyperextend your lumbar spine. Hyperextension is just as dangerous as hyperflexion.

2
Start with both hands on the handle and your fists against your chest.
3
Press the handle forward until your elbows are fully extended, then pull the handle back to your chest.

How To Perform The Cable Pallof Press

Setup

You want the cable at roughly nipple height. Use a d handle attachment or a nylon plastic handle. Either interlock your fingers or place one set of fingers over the other. Whichever is more comfortable.

Take a couple of steps away from the cable stack and face sideways. The cable itself should be pulling you to the side. Use a slightly wider than shoulder width stance. Don't be hesitant to further widen your stance. The wider your stance, the bigger your base of support and the more weight you will likely be able to use.

Performing

Start with your fists up against your chest. Press the cable away from you until your elbows are fully extended. In this extended position you should feel your obliques contract. The further away from your center of gravity the resistance goes, the harder it is on the obliques. This is why it is of the utmost importance that you fully extend your elbows on each rep. That extended position is the most important part of the movement so spend an extra second with your elbows extended. If you start fatiguing to a point you're unable to maintain your torso position, end the set.

The cable should be set all the way at the top of the machine.

Make sure to keep your upper arm glued at your side. Extend your elbows until you feel your triceps contract.

How To Perform The Cable Pushdown
Set Up
Set the cable pin all the way to the top. You can use a rope or a straight bar attachment for this exercise. In our demo video, we are using a rope so our instructions will be specific to that.
Grab onto the rope and take a few steps back. You can start with your elbows in an extended or flexed position.
Push your butt back slightly. This will get your hips out of the way giving your arms enough room to fully extend.
Performing The Cable Pushdown
My favorite cue to use on the Tricep Push Down is, ""T-Rex arms."" It's extremely important that you keep your upper arm and your elbows glued to your side. Your elbow joint should be causing the movement and your forearm should be the only moving body part. This will keep the stress and tension purely on your triceps and not recruit other body parts. Make sure to fully extend and flex your elbows on each rep.
Be careful of swinging and bouncing on this exercise. It is very common to use too much weight on this exercise. If you find yourself having to use momentum, the weight is too heavy.
Also, if you notice your shoulders beginning to roll forward on the concentric, the weight is too heavy. Your central nervous system is extremely intelligent and will help you get from point A to point B by any means necessary. It will begin trying to recruit your anterior deltoid and pec major by rolling your shoulders forward on top of the rope or straight bar so you can press the weight down instead of performing a strict Triceps Extension.

With your body hanging and arms fully extended, pull yourself up until your chin is past the bar.

Slowly return to starting position. Repeat.

How To Perform The Chin Up

Setup

Grab the Chin Up bar with an underhand grip. Make sure the bars are set very deeply in your hand. Your palms should be making contact with the bar. 

Next, if you are using a bench or box to reach the Chin Up bars, step off of the step, and hold for a second, in a dead hang position. If you begin initiating the reps before the dead hang, you might swing too much to perform the exercise strictly. If you can reach the  bars without having to stand on anything, take your grip and then pull your feet slightly off the floor. Still hold for a second to prevent any swinging from happening.

Pull your shoulder blades down. This will engage your mid and lower traps and force your lats to do most of the work. Also, before beginning the first rep, make sure your elbows are extended.

Lower body
Angle your legs forward slightly, push your hips back, and point your toes. This will force you to flex your abdominals and keep you more stable throughout the rep. (This will massively help you keep the reps strict).

Performing
Once you are in the proper position, begin to pull. Imagine trying to pull your elbows straight down to your sides.

Get your chin over the bar before beginning the eccentric portion of the rap. Your elbows should fully extend at the bottom of each rep.

Progressing The Chin Up



Decide on a rep range. For example, 6 to 10. Once you are able to perform 10 reps with strict form, then it is time to progress. Do not be shy or hesitant to start adding weight  early on. Even if it is only 5 pounds. Progress is progress! From there, progress like you would any other exercise. Once you hit the top end of the rep range, add some more weight.

The best way to get better at doing Chin Ups is to do Chin Ups. But if you can't do them in the first place, then what should you do? 

Try the Neutral Grip Chin Up. It’s an easier variation because the lats are in their strongest position.

Shorten the range of motion, and try to get a longer range of motion overtime. if you can only do half a Chin Up,  (meaning you can get your elbows to roughly 90°) don't be ashamed to do those half reps. Set a rep range like with anything else. We will use 5 to 8 reps for this example. Once you are able to hit 8 of the half reps, try to go an extra 2 to 3 inches higher on each rep. You won't be able to do 8 when you advance the range of motion. So Build your way back up to 8.

How To Perform the Dumbbell Bicep Curl

Setup
Grab two dumbbells and stand tall with your shoulder blades pulled back and your chest poked out. You can start with either the dumbbells in front of your quads or off to the sides of your legs. Whichever is more comfortable. Also, whichever will allow you to fully extend your elbows at the bottom of each rep.

Use a shoulder width or slightly inside of shoulder width stance. 

Performing 
Begin the rep by flexing your elbows. Try to touch your forearms to your biceps at the very top of the movement. Then begin the eccentric. Make sure to fully extend your elbows at the bottom of each rep so you get a full range of motion. 

It is easy to use momentum on a bicep curl. We want our muscles and not momentum to do the work. So make sure you keep these strict. If you find yourself swinging the weight up, then your biceps have hit fatigue and it's time to end the set.

How To Perform The Dumbbell Incline Bench Press

Setup
Set an incline bench at around 30° high. Any higher than 30°, and the tension will go to your anterior deltoid as opposed to your upper pecs. A low incline is all you need. 

Getting the dumbbells into position for an incline bench press can be challenging. You've got a couple of options here.
Start with the dumbbells sitting vertically on your quads. Push one leg up toward the ceiling and get your elbow underneath the dumbbell. Then repeat on the other leg with the other dumbbell as you fall back onto the bench. 
Have a gym partner help out. If you're going to have someone help. Make sure they either grab your wrists or the dumbbells themselves to help you get into position. Some people have a tendency to push the elbows up in order to get the dumbbells in position for this move. This can be dangerous as the dumbbell might fall laterally one direction, or another.

Make sure both feet are planted firmly on the ground. Push your toes through the front of your shoes. This will generate some tension through your quads and keep you more stable. 

Like any other bench press, pull your shoulder blades back and dig them into the bench. Also point your ribs up toward the ceiling, giving yourself a minor arch in your spine. 

Performing 
Press the weights up toward the ceiling to initiate your first rep. Extend your elbows, but do not fully lock them out. As you perform the eccentric, maintain a 45° angle between your upper arm and torso. Your elbows should not be flared all the way out, or tucked all the way in, but in the middle between the two. 

Stop the eccentric when your elbows are even with your torso or slightly behind your torso. The pecs are not designed well to function when your upper arm travels behind your body. Because the pecs are two lengthened in this position, they will not be able to generate force properly. All the tension from the dumbbells will go onto your shoulder joint instead of your muscles. 

Getting from underneath the dumbbells at the end of the set can be challenging as well. You also have two options here. 
If you end the set by completing your last rep, meaning your elbows are extended and the dumbbells are away from your body, turn your fists into a neutral position, lift your legs up touching the dumbbell to your quads, and then roll your entire body forward. This can take some practice, so try it with light dumbbells first.
If you end the set not having completed your final rep, meaning the dumbbells are against your chest, then you have no choice but to dump the dumbbells off of you onto the ground. Be very careful with this. Do your best to control the weights as you get them off of you, so they do not bounce. If the dumbbells bounce off the floor and land on someone's foot, you have an issue on your hands. Some gyms don't want any dropping of weights at all. Try to set them down as gently as possible, but don't injure yourself in the process.

How To Perform The Seated Dumbbell Overhead Press

Setup
Grab two dumbbells and set up on an incline or seated bench. Make sure your back is pressed all the way into the vertical pad.

Flare your elbows out. Your face should be facing the ceiling and your palms facing forward. Also, make sure the dumbbell is set very deeply in your hand so your wrist stays in a strong position for the entire set.

Performing 
Press the dumbbells up toward the ceiling, fully extending your elbows. Do not hyperextend or lockout your elbows as this is dangerous for those joints. The dumbbells should travel in an arc-like curve. With the dumbbells converging at the top of the ramp. There's no need to touch the dumbbells together at the top, but there's nothing wrong if they do.

After extending your elbows, begin the eccentric portion of the rep. Make sure your upper arm at least reaches parallel with the ground before initiating the next concentric. If you have the shoulder mobility, you can go all the way to the point the dumbbells tap your shoulders. This may give people with shoulder issues some pain. If it does, cut the range of motion a little shorter.

Make sure your back stays flat against the vertical pad for the entire set. There is a tendency to begin extending the spine when fatiguing on an overhead press. Your nervous system understands that you are stronger pushing horizontally than you are pushing vertically. And so it will begin to point your chest up toward the ceiling to try to involve your pecs. Don't let this happen. A hyperextended spine with a weight pushing straight down from overhead will place a lot of unneeded stress on your lumbar spine.

How To Perform The Seated Shrug

Setup

Grab two dumbbells and sit at the edge of either a bench or box. Bring your legs relatively close together, so they are out of the way of the dumbbells.

Use the cue, ""superman chest."" Imagine you have the Superman logo on your chest and show it off. This will open your chest and force you to sit tall while pulling your shoulder blades back.
Let your arms be in a dead hang position.

Performing the Seated Shrug

Pull your shoulder joint straight up toward the ceiling. Get your shoulders as high as you can. You should feel your traps contract very hard when you have hit an adequate range of motion. From this point, begin to drop your shoulders back down to the starting position.

Avoid rolling your shoulders. This is a very common form mistake on shrugs. The upper portion of the traps elevates the scapula, while the mid and lower traps, retract and depress the scapula. However, when you are in a seated or standing position the dumbbells will be pulling downward (because of gravity) so scapular elevation is the only anatomical function being performed against resistance. Therefore, retracting and depressing the scapula on each rep (rolling the shoulders) will not recruit your mid and lower traps. You would need a different exercise for that.

Also, pay particular attention to your neck. It is also very common to push one's head forward when performing a shrug. This can put unnecessary stress on your neck and cervical spine. Keep your chin pulled back and your head in a neutral position.

How To Perform The Dumbbell Wood Chopper
Setup
Grab a single dumbbell and hold it horizontally with the ends of the dumbbells in each hand. Use a wider than shoulder width stance. We have to hit both sides of the obliques with this exercise. So we will begin with going right to left. You can perform either side first.
Start with the dumbbell on the outside of your right quadricep.
Performing 
Think explosively when performing this movement. Rotate at the spine bringing the dumbbell from your right quadricep up to roughly eye level on your left side. Keep your elbows mostly extended. Do not rotate too far. The dumbbell should not go behind your body. Going behind the body will put too much stress on your lumbar spine. 
Also, as you are rotating at the spine, pivot your back foot. Your right foot in this example. Imagine you are performing a baseball bat or golf swing. Pivoting that back foot will keep your back knee from twisting too far.

Forearm Plank Detailed How to:

Setup

I suggest starting in a kneeling position as opposed to starting with your hips on the ground. When you begin from the hips on the ground position, your lumbar spine is hyperextended, which is dangerous and to be avoided in the overwhelming majority of exercises.
You can either do a closed fist or open hand position. Whichever feels more comfortable. Step one foot back, and then the other to begin the Plank.

Performing The Forearm Plank

Be careful to not let your hips rise or sag as you were holding the forearm Plank. Maintain a flat back the entire set. If you are having trouble knowing if your back is flat, try performing the exercise in front of a mirror so you can check your form. 

Continuously press your elbows into the ground and spread your scapula. This will recruit your serratus anterior and get you some extra core work.

How To Progress The Forearm Plank:

Like any other exercise, progression is important with the Plank. However, since the Plank is a hold and not a dynamic exercise with reps, it can be challenging knowing how to and when to progress the Plank. Here’s a quick step by step guide on progressing the Plank

Set a range similar to a rep range. For example, 45 to 60 seconds. Let’s say in the beginning you are only able to do 45 seconds. Each week, try to add a bit more time (2-5 secs). Once you are able to complete 60 seconds with good form time to further progress.
Switch to a more difficult variation. The natural next step is switching to the Hand Plank. Keep your same time range of 45-60 seconds. Since this is a more difficult variation you will likely fatigue before 60 seconds. Build your way back to 60 seconds like you did with the Forearm Plank. 
Add weight. At this point, it’s time to try adding some resistance to the Plank. Start light! You can either ask a gym buddy or place the weight on your back yourself. Either way, make sure the plate is in the middle of your upper back and not your lumbar spine. Then you can progress the plank similarly to any other exercise. By adding weight bit by bit overtime.
You can continue to progress by going to a more difficult hold (Long Lever Plank, Hollow Hold) and then adding weight to those over time.

How To Forward Lunge

Setup

Start with your feet about shoulder width apart and toes facing forward. Use the cue superman chest throughout the entirety of the set. Meaning, imagine you have the superman logo on your chest and show off that logo for the entirety of the set. This will help you keep a tall chest and your shoulder blades pulled back. Also, this cue will help you keep your torso vertical.

Performing

Initiate the first rep by taking a step forward. You should dictate your stride length by the body part you'd like to focus on. Use a shorter stride length if you want to recruit the quads more. The shorter stride length will increase the range of motion at your knees. If you want to recruit the glutes a bit more, take a longer stride. A longer stride will increase the range of motion at the hips.

You can either let your arms stay to your sides, you can place your hands on your hips (as you can see in our demo video) or you can use prayer hands.

Let your back knee gently tap the floor. Push off your front heel explosively to push yourself back into the starting position. You can either do all reps on one side or alternate sides.

As you fatigue, be careful to not let your chest begin to sag forward, or let your lumbar spine round.  If the forward lunge is too difficult, try out a reverse lunge. It's an easier variation.

Start in a kneeling position with your hands planted on the ground.
2
Pick your knees up off the ground. Hold in this position with a flat back.

Hand Plank Detailed How to:

Setup

I suggest starting in a kneeling position as opposed to starting with your hips on the ground. When you begin from the hips on the ground position, your lumbar spine is hyperextended, which is dangerous and to be avoided in the overwhelming majority of exercises.
You can either do a closed fist or open hand position. Whichever feels more comfortable. Step one foot back, and then the other to begin the Plank.

Performing The Hand Plank

Be careful to not let your hips rise or sag as you were holding the Hand Plank. Maintain a flat back the entire set. If you are having trouble knowing if your back is flat, try performing the exercise in front of a mirror so you can check your form. 

Continuously press your hands into the ground and spread your scapula. This will recruit your serratus anterior and get you some extra core work.

How To Progress The Hand Plank:

Like any other exercise, progression is important with the Plank. However, since the Plank is a hold and not a dynamic exercise with reps, it can be challenging knowing how to and when to progress the Plank. Here’s a quick step by step guide on progressing the Plank

Set a range similar to a rep range. For example, 45 to 60 seconds. Let’s say in the beginning you are only able to do 45 seconds. Each week, try to add a bit more time (2-5 secs). Once you are able to complete 60 seconds with good form time to further progress.
Switch to a more difficult variation. The natural next step is switching to the Hand Plank. Keep your same time range of 45-60 seconds. Since this is a more difficult variation you will likely fatigue before 60 seconds. Build your way back to 60 seconds like you did with the Forearm Plank. 
Add weight. At this point, it’s time to try adding some resistance to the Plank. Start light! You can either ask a gym buddy or place the weight on your back yourself. Either way, make sure the plate is in the middle of your upper back and not your lumbar spine. Then you can progress the plank similarly to any other exercise. By adding weight bit by bit overtime.
You can continue to progress by going to a more difficult hold (Long Lever Plank, Hollow Hold) and then adding weight to those over time.

After a second of squeezing, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended.

How To Perform The Pulldown

Setup

First, adjust the thigh pad to a position that works well with your height. You should be able to put your legs under the thigh pad fully, but it should be low enough to keep you glued to the chair.

There are several grips you can use on a pull down.  In our demo video, we are doing a wide grip overhand pull down, so these instructions will be for that variation in particular.

Take an overhand grip just outside the part of the bar that bends downward. You can either use a thumbed or thumbless grip.

Hold on tight to the weight and sit straight down throwing your legs underneath the thigh pad. 

Performing

Before you start the rep, make sure your elbows are in a fully extended position. Your ears should be between your biceps. As you initiate the pull, lean back slightly. Imagine you are trying to pull your elbows in toward your rib cage, and not just downward. The bar should land between your collarbone and nipple line. 

Once you have tapped your chest begin the eccentric. Control the weight on the way back up. The rep will end with your elbows returning to their fully extended position.

Be careful about cheating on this exercise. It is very easy (and very common) to use momentum on this exercise. If you are using some body English and jerking the weight to get it from point A to point B and the weight is too heavy. Try going lighter and controlling during both the concentric and eccentric.

How To Use The Standing Calve Raise Machine

Setup

Adjust the height of the shoulder pads to where you have to do a miniature squat to get the weight in position to begin the set. This will help you get a longer range of motion.
Place the balls of your feet on the edge of the platform and perform your mini squat to start the set.

Performing The Standing Calve Raise

Let the weight fully flex your ankles and look for what feels like a stretch in your calves at the bottom of each rep. Spend an extra second in this stretched position. There is some indication that stretching a muscle while under a load is great for muscle growth.

Then initiate the concentric. Extend your ankles to the degree that your range of motion allows for. Imagine you have a string on both heels being pulled directly up toward the ceiling. When you have gone high enough, you should feel your calves contract hard. Spend an extra second in this contracted position before beginning the eccentric.

How To Perform The Pull Up
Setup
Grab the Pull Up bar with an overhand grip. If you get wrist pain from gripping a Pull Up bar, try using a thumbless grip. It won't affect your grip strength too much, but will give your wrists a little more room to move. Also, make sure the bars are set very deeply in your hand. Your palms should be making contact with the bar. 
Next, if you are using a bench or box to reach the Pull Up bars, step off of the step, and hold for a second, in a dead hang position. If you begin initiating the Pull Up before the dead hang, you might swing too much to perform a proper strict Pull Up. If you can reach the Pull Up bars without having to stand on anything, take your grip and then pull your feet slightly off the floor. Still hold for a second to prevent any swinging from happening.
Pull your shoulder blades down. This will engage your mid and lower traps and force your lats to do most of the work. Also, before beginning the first rep, make sure your elbows are extended.
Lower body
Angle your legs forward slightly, push your hips back, and point your toes. This will force you to flex your abdominals and keep you more stable throughout the rep. (This will massively help you keep the reps strict).
Performing
Once you are in the proper position, begin to pull. Imagine trying to pull your elbows not just down, but inward toward your spine. This cue will help you engage one of the lats’ more overlooked functions, vertical adduction. 
Get your chin over the bar before beginning the eccentric portion of the rap. Your elbows should fully extend at the bottom of each rep.
Step by Step Progression
The Pull Up can be a difficult exercise to know when to progress. There's also the question of how to progress the Pull Up. 
Decide on a rep range. For example, 6 to 10. Once you are able to perform 10 reps with strict form, then it is time to progress. Do not be shy or hesitant to start adding weight to your Pull Up early on. Even if it is only 5 pounds. Progress is progress! From there, progress the Pull Up, like it would any other exercise. Once you hit the top end of the rep range, add some more weight.
The best way to get better at doing Pull Ups is to do Pull Ups. But if you can't do them in the first place, then what should you do? 
Try the Chin Up. It’s an easier variation because the biceps are much more involved. I suggest you start with that variation if you don't have much experience doing Pull Ups. 
Shorten the range of motion, and try to get a longer range of motion overtime. if you can only do half a Pull Up (meaning you can get your elbows to roughly 90°) don't be ashamed to do those half reps. Set a rep range like with anything else. We will use 5 to 8 reps for this example. Once you are able to hit 8/2 Pull Ups, cut the reps down to five and try to go an extra 2 to 3 inches higher on each rep. It helps massively if you can do this in front of a mirror to keep a very close eye on your range of motion. Before long you'll be able to perform full reps.
