Hold the kettlebell in a racked position (bell resting on your forearm, elbow tucked in) or in a farmer's carry position (arm extended down at your side)

2
Keeping your chest up and core engaged, take a large step backward and diagonally with the leg opposite to the hand holding the kettlebell. Your back foot should land behind and outside of your front foot, as if you are doing a curtsy

3
As you step back, lower your hips straight down until your front thigh is parallel to the floor and your back knee is hovering just above the ground. Ensure your front knee is tracking over your toes and not caving inward, and your torso remains upright

4
Push off the back foot and drive through the heel of your front foot to return to the starting standing position. Maintain control and balance as you bring your feet back together

5
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions on one side before switching the kettlebell to the other hand and performing the exercise on the other leg",https://musclewiki.com/kettlebells/male/glutes/Kettlebell-single-arm-curtsy-lunge/,,,Intermediate,
